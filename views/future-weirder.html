   <h5>Starting Scenario</h5>
   <p>
    Libraries are the center of new revolution in shareable, open, and aggressively local
    community centers that focus on cataloging, sharing, and promoting the virtual and physical
    artifacts created by their communities. Cheap 3D Printing, coupled with significant copyright
    reform by the United States, has created an explosion of creative remixing of intellectual
    and creative works. Librarians are firmly grounded in the idea of libraries being a magical
    place of discovery and learning as they embrace a much more inclusive definition of collections.
    These augmented spaces start with merging and growth of smart, embedded objects 
    that draw design inspiration from the ancient and renaissance 
    <a href="/calli-2012-presentation/glossary.html#memory-theatre">memory theatres</a> that offer
    a whole suite of interaction opportunities and enhancements that seem magical to the particpants
    Artifactsin these libraries span both the physical and digital with
    powerful manifestations that compliment each other.  
  </p>
   <p>
    With the growth and proliferation of small and large datasets, generated by pervasive sensors, video
    feeds, and people's actions, including for most people, a basic
    genetic profile, they are starting to be concerned about the permanence and legacy of these data-sets.
    Libraries, recognizing this as an extension of their existing
    services and philosophy; collect, share, and curate these small-to-midsize data sets.
    These services start by collaborating with other libraries and memory institutions to offer an open-standards
    life-vault service that allows patrons to archive and preserve these datasets with options to share
    as much as little with the world and their community.   
   </p>
   <p>
    Libraries share their collections and their technologies in whole new ways to support these
    roles. Libraries connect both laterally with local, regional, state-wide libraries 
    and also horizontally within their communities by becoming the center for these new creative activities
    and actively manage the creative artifacts, including supporting data sets, of their communities.

   <h3>Leadership Questions</h3>
   <ul style="margin-left: 1em">
    <li>How would you answer the question, "What will library technology 
        collaboration in Colorado look like in 2018?" given this scenario</li>
    <li>While the two trends listed in this scenario are only two possible disruptors to library technology collaboration,
        what other trends to you think could shift libraries role into the weird?</li>
    <li>What choices and leadership can we build upon in our current library technology that would position us for us respond
        quicker to a brand-new area or opportunity that did not exist before?</li>
